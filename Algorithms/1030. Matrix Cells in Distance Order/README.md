# [1030. Matrix Cells in Distance Order](https://leetcode.com/problems/matrix-cells-in-distance-order/)

## 题目

We are given a matrix with R rows and C columns has cells with integer coordinates (r, c), where 0 <= r < R and 0 <= c < C.

Additionally, we are given a cell in that matrix with coordinates (r0, c0).

Return the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their distance from (r0, c0) from smallest distance to largest distance.  Here, the distance between two cells (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) is the Manhattan distance, |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|.  (You may return the answer in any order that satisfies this condition.)

 

Example 1:

```c
Input: R = 1, C = 2, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
Output: [[0,0],[0,1]]
Explanation: The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1]
```

Example 2:

```c
Input: R = 2, C = 2, r0 = 0, c0 = 1
Output: [[0,1],[0,0],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2]
The answer [[0,1],[1,1],[0,0],[1,0]] would also be accepted as correct.
```

Example 3:

```c
Input: R = 2, C = 3, r0 = 1, c0 = 2
Output: [[1,2],[0,2],[1,1],[0,1],[1,0],[0,0]]
Explanation: The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2,2,3]
There are other answers that would also be accepted as correct, such as [[1,2],[1,1],[0,2],[1,0],[0,1],[0,0]].
```

Note:

1. 1 <= R <= 100
2. 1 <= C <= 100
3. 0 <= r0 < R
4. 0 <= c0 < C


## 题目大意

定义矩阵中两个元素的距离是：`(r1, c1) 和 (r2, c2) 的距离 = |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`。求出矩阵中所有元素距离 `(r0, c0)` 的距离。矩阵中的元素按照坐标系的规则排列。


## 解题思路

按照题意计算矩阵内给定点到其他每个点的距离即可。
