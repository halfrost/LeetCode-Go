# [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/)

## 题目

Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

Note:
You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2. The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
