## Installation

Navigate to your hugo project root and run:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book themes/book
```

Then run hugo (or set `theme = "book"`/`theme: book` in configuration file)

```
hugo server --minify --theme book
```

### Creating site from scratch

Below is an example on how to create a new site from scratch:

```sh
hugo new site mydocs; cd mydocs
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book themes/book
cp -R themes/book/exampleSite/content .
```

```sh
hugo server --minify --theme book
```

## Menu

### File tree menu (default)

By default, the theme will render pages from the `content/docs` section as a menu in a tree structure.  
You can set `title` and `weight` in the front matter of pages to adjust the order and titles in the menu.

### Leaf bundle menu

You can also use leaf bundle and the content of its `index.md` file as menu.  
Given you have the following file structure:

```
├── content
│   ├── docs
│   │   ├── page-one.md
│   │   └── page-two.md
│   └── posts
│       ├── post-one.md
│       └── post-two.md
```

Create a file `content/menu/index.md` with the content:

```md
+++
headless = true
+++

- [Book Example]({{< relref "/docs/" >}})
  - [Page One]({{< relref "/docs/page-one" >}})
  - [Page Two]({{< relref "/docs/page-two" >}})
- [Blog]({{< relref "/posts" >}})
```

And Enable it by setting `BookMenuBundle: /menu` in Site configuration.

- [Example menu](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book/blob/master/exampleSite/content/menu/index.md)
- [Example config file](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book/blob/master/exampleSite/config.yaml)
- [Leaf bundles](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/)

## Blog

A simple blog is supported in the section `posts`.  
A blog is not the primary usecase of this theme, so it has only minimal features.

## Configuration

### Site Configuration

There are a few configuration options that you can add to your `config.toml` file.  
You can also see the `yaml` example [here](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book/blob/master/exampleSite/config.yaml).

```toml
# (Optional) Set Google Analytics if you use it to track your website.
# Always put it on the top of the configuration file, otherwise it won't work
googleAnalytics = "UA-XXXXXXXXX-X"

# (Optional) If you provide a Disqus shortname, comments will be enabled on
# all pages.
disqusShortname = "my-site"

# (Optional) Set this to true if you use capital letters in file names
disablePathToLower = true

# (Optional) Set this to true to enable 'Last Modified by' date and git author
#  information on 'doc' type pages.
enableGitInfo = true

# (Optional) Theme is intended for documentation use, therefore it doesn't render taxonomy.
# You can remove related files with config below
disableKinds = ['taxonomy', 'taxonomyTerm']

[params]
  # (Optional, default light) Sets color theme: light, dark or auto.
  # Theme 'auto' switches between dark and light modes based on browser/os preferences
  BookTheme = 'light'

  # (Optional, default true) Controls table of contents visibility on right side of pages.
  # Start and end levels can be controlled with markup.tableOfContents setting.
  # You can also specify this parameter per page in front matter.
  BookToC = true

  # (Optional, default none) Set the path to a logo for the book. If the logo is
  # /static/logo.png then the path would be 'logo.png'
  BookLogo = 'logo.png'

  # (Optional, default none) Set leaf bundle to render as side menu
  # When not specified file structure and weights will be used
  BookMenuBundle = '/menu'

  # (Optional, default docs) Specify section of content to render as menu
  # You can also set value to "*" to render all sections to menu
  BookSection = 'docs'

  # Set source repository location.
  # Used for 'Last Modified' and 'Edit this page' links.
  BookRepo = 'https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book'
  
  # Specifies commit portion of the link to the page's last modified commit hash for 'doc' page
  # type.
  # Required if 'BookRepo' param is set.
  # Value used to construct a URL consisting of BookRepo/BookCommitPath/<commit-hash>
  # Github uses 'commit', Bitbucket uses 'commits'
  BookCommitPath = 'commit'

  # Enable 'Edit this page' links for 'doc' page type.
  # Disabled by default. Uncomment to enable. Requires 'BookRepo' param.
  # Path must point to the site directory.
  BookEditPath = 'edit/master/exampleSite'

  # (Optional, default January 2, 2006) Configure the date format used on the pages
  # - In git information
  # - In blog posts
  BookDateFormat = 'Jan 2, 2006'

  # (Optional, default true) Enables search function with flexsearch,
  # Index is built on fly, therefore it might slowdown your website.
  # Configuration for indexing can be adjusted in i18n folder per language.
  BookSearch = true

  # (Optional, default true) Enables comments template on pages
  # By default partials/docs/comments.html includes Disqus template
  # See https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/#configure-disqus
  # Can be overwritten by same param in page frontmatter
  BookComments = true

  # /!\ This is an experimental feature, might be removed or changed at any time
  # (Optional, experimental, default false) Enables portable links and link checks in markdown pages.
  # Portable links meant to work with text editors and let you write markdown without {{< relref >}} shortcode
  # Theme will print warning if page referenced in markdown does not exists.
  BookPortableLinks = true

  # /!\ This is an experimental feature, might be removed or changed at any time
  # (Optional, experimental, default false) Enables service worker that caches visited pages and resources for offline use.
  BookServiceWorker = true
```

### Multi-Language Support

Theme supports Hugo's [multilingual mode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/), just follow configuration guide there. You can also tweak search indexing configuration per language in `i18n` folder.

### Page Configuration

You can specify additional params in the front matter of individual pages:

```toml
# Set type to 'docs' if you want to render page outside of configured section or if you render section other than 'docs'
type = 'docs'

# Set page weight to re-arrange items in file-tree menu (if BookMenuBundle not set)
weight = 10

# (Optional) Set to 'true' to mark page as flat section in file-tree menu (if BookMenuBundle not set)
bookFlatSection = false

# (Optional) Set to hide nested sections or pages at that level. Works only with file-tree menu mode
bookCollapseSection = true

# (Optional) Set true to hide page or section from side menu (if BookMenuBundle not set)
bookHidden = false

# (Optional) Set 'false' to hide ToC from page
bookToC = true

# (Optional) If you have enabled BookComments for the site, you can disable it for specific pages.
bookComments = true

# (Optional) Set to 'false' to exclude page from search index.
bookSearchExclude = true
```

### Partials

There are few empty partials you can override in `layouts/partials/`

| Partial                                            | Placement                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |

### Extra Customisation

| File                     | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `static/favicon.png`     | Override default favicon                                                              |
| `assets/_custom.scss`    | Customise or override scss styles                                                     |
| `assets/_variables.scss` | Override default SCSS variables                                                       |
| `assets/_fonts.scss`     | Replace default font with custom fonts (e.g. local files or remote like google fonts) |
| `assets/mermaid.json`    | Replace Mermaid initialization config                                                 |

### Plugins

There are a few features implemented as plugable `scss` styles. Usually these are features that don't make it to the core but can still be useful.

| Plugin                            | Description                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `assets/plugins/_numbered.scss`   | Makes headings in markdown numbered, e.g. `1.1`, `1.2`      |
| `assets/plugins/_scrollbars.scss` | Overrides scrollbar styles to look similar across platforms |

To enable plugins, add `@import "plugins/{name}";` to `assets/_custom.scss` in your website root.

### Hugo Internal Templates

There are a few hugo templates inserted in `<head>`

- [Google Analytics](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics)
- [Open Graph](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#open-graph)

## Shortcodes

- [Buttons](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-book/docs/shortcodes/buttons/)
- [Columns](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-book/docs/shortcodes/columns/)
- [Expand](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-book/docs/shortcodes/expand/)
- [Hints](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-book/docs/shortcodes/hints/)
- [KaTeX](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-book/docs/shortcodes/katex/)
- [Mermaid](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-book/docs/shortcodes/mermaid/)
- [Tabs](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-book/docs/shortcodes/tabs/)

By default, Goldmark trims unsafe outputs which might prevent some shortcodes from rendering. It is recommended to set `markup.goldmark.renderer.unsafe=true` if you encounter problems.

```toml
[markup.goldmark.renderer]
  unsafe = true
```

If you are using `config.yaml` or `config.json`, consult the [configuration markup](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/)

## Versioning

This theme follows a simple incremental versioning. e.g. `v1`, `v2` and so on. There might be breaking changes between versions.

If you want lower maintenance, use one of the released versions. If you want to live on the bleeding edge of changes, you can use the `master` branch and update your website when needed.

## Contributing

### [Extra credits to contributors](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book/graphs/contributors)

Contributions are welcome and I will review and consider pull requests.  
Primary goals are:

- Keep it simple.
- Keep minimal (or zero) default configuration.
- Avoid interference with user-defined layouts.
- Avoid using JS if it can be solved by CSS.

Feel free to open issues if you find missing configuration or customisation options.
