# [1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-highest-and-lowest-of-k-scores/)

## 题目

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the score of the ith student. You are also given an integer k.

Pick the scores of any k students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the k scores is minimized.

Return the minimum possible difference.

**Example 1:**

    Input: nums = [90], k = 1
    Output: 0
    Explanation: There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
    - [90]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
    The minimum possible difference is 0.

**Example 2:**

    Input: nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
    Output: 2
    Explanation: There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
    - [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
    - [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
    - [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
    - [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
    - [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
    - [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
    The minimum possible difference is 2.

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 100000

## 题目大意

给你一个下标从 0 开始的整数数组 nums ，其中 nums[i] 表示第 i 名学生的分数。另给你一个整数 k 。

从数组中选出任意 k 名学生的分数，使这 k 个分数间最高分和最低分的差值达到最小化 。

返回可能的最小差值 。

## 解题思路

- nums 排序
- 求出nums[i+k-1] - nums[i]中的最小差值

## 代码

```go
package leetcode

import "sort"

func minimumDifference(nums []int, k int) int {
	sort.Ints(nums)
	minDiff := 100000 + 1
	for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
		if i+k-1 >= len(nums) {
			break
		}
		diff := nums[i+k-1] - nums[i]
		if diff < minDiff {
			minDiff = diff
		}
	}
	return minDiff
}
```
